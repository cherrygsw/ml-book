This is a companion webpage to the book "Mathematics For Machine Learning"

Currently working on writing a book on Mathematics for Machiine Learning that motivates users to pursue their interest in mathematical concepts. This book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, this aims to provide a basic understanding of the necessary mathematical skills to read other advance machine learning books.
