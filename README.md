This is a companion webpage to the book "Mathematics For Machine Learning"

[https://mml-book.com](https://mml-book.com)

Currently working on writing a book on Mathematics for Machiine Learning that motivates users to pursue their interest in mathematical concepts. This book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, this aims to provide a basic understanding of the necessary mathematical skills to read other advance machine learning books.

Let's split the book into two parts:

* Mathematical foundations
* Examples of machine learning algorithms that use mathematical foundations

Let's aim to keep this book short, because it is hard to cover everything. We will also provide exercises for part 1 and jupyter notebooks for part 2 of the book.

The notebooks can be run live on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/master?filepath=tutorials).

Alternatively try them directly on **Google Colab**
